# Abstract

Finger identification technology along with capacitive touch screens on electronic devices is becoming more and more popular and there are many research on this issue. Previous works have presented many approaches in determining which finger touched the display but have encountered many limitations: Machine Learning is not effective in handling complex cases while Deep Learning methods provide higher accuracy but are limited by high energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce the application of SNN in the problem of finger identification using capacitive images. We collect a raw data set of low-resolution fingerprints, process the data, train and optimize on Neural Network and then convert to Spiking Neural Network. We focus mainly on the index finger and thumb which are the two fingers mainly used for human finger manipulation. As a result, we achieved over 93% accuracy in distinguishing left and right thumbs with the optimal NN model and close to 90% with the SNN model. At the same time, the SNN implementation on neuromorphic hardware is estimated to consume 13 times less energy than GPUs and 400 times less than CPUs.
